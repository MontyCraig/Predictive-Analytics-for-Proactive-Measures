Predictive Analytics for Proactive Measures

By utilizing predictive analytics, businesses can forecast potential disruptions before they occur. 

Machine learning models trained on historical data can identify patterns and anomalies that signal impending risks, 

such as supply chain bottlenecks or market volatility. For example, time series analysis can help forecast demand fluctuations, 

allowing companies to adjust production schedules proactively.
